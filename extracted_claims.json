  "cleaned_text": "Discussions about science, history, and public policy often blend verified information with assumptions and oversimplified narratives. Articles written for general audiences frequently prioritize readability over precision, which can result in confident statements that sound factual but lack solid grounding. As a result, readers may accept inaccurate claims simply because they are presented alongside correct information.\n\nIn the field of physics, Albert Einstein is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the twentieth century. He published the theory of general relativity in 1915, a development that fundamentally changed how gravity is understood in modern physics. However, some popular accounts incorrectly state that Einstein received the Nobel Prize specifically for his work on relativity, even though the award citation focused on a different contribution.\n\nTurning to geography, the Amazon River is often described as one of the longest rivers in the world. It is frequently claimed that the Amazon is the longest river on Earth, surpassing the Nile in total length, although this assertion depends on measurement methods and remains debated. At the same time, it is sometimes incorrectly stated that the Amazon River flows entirely within Brazil, a claim that overlooks its passage through multiple South American countries.\n\nIn discussions about energy, nuclear power is sometimes portrayed in absolute terms. Uranium-235 is a commonly used fuel in nuclear reactors, and it is occasionally claimed that nuclear energy produces zero radioactive waste. While such statements are appealing in simplified debates, they often ignore important technical distinctions that are central to how nuclear systems actually operate.\n\nHistorical narratives can also be misleading when reduced to single sentences. The Roman Empire fell in 476 CE, a date often cited as the definitive end of Roman rule in Europe. However, it is sometimes incorrectly asserted that the Roman Empire completely ceased to exist at that point, despite the continued existence of the Eastern Roman Empire for nearly a thousand years afterward.\n\nOverall, the presence of both accurate facts and subtle inaccuracies within the same text highlights why automated systems must carefully separate verifiable claims from popular misconceptions and oversimplified conclusions.",
